# weather_dashboard_5_day

## A weather app 

This project provides the user with a simple weather dashboard that will display the current weather of a certain city as well as a 5 day projection.

## Project Status

There are several areas in need of debugging:

* localStorage items will only temporarily clear -> need to look into `remove()`
* list of recently searched cities do not populate on page load -> look into `window.onload`
* list of recently searched cities need `addEventListener()`
* both weather disaply sections will add on from a second search -> also look into `remove()`

### Project-build aspects

The following was used to build the code for this day planner:

1. HTML and CSS
2. Bootstrap used to build main section for DOM manipulation as commented in `index.html`
3. Moment.js used to display user local time
4. API call using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
5. JQuery used for DOM manipulation in `script.js`

### Functionality

The following lists all functions within the project:

*Please also refer to the **Project Status** section*

* user input area for entering and searching a "city name"
* list of recently searched cities
* this list can be cleared by using the **"Clear History"** button

* 5 day projection forecast showing:

### Process
